1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?
I use boostrap because it is a good library, it makes the design much more attractive and it is what I have used the most

Service worker because i need this library for the consume of my APIS

Routing Module without a doubt one of the best libraries that are integrated since it is easy to access and manage

Angular Router because i need to use them to receive the parameter doi for the first API and receive it by the second API

2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
More design because I feel that although nobody takes it into account it is one of the most fundamental parts of a web page

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
When trying to access the doi value of the api, it was easy for me, but I really liked learning something new, which was the angular router, a good part of which was through the url that the parent component sent me, receiving it through the child component and obtaining the value doi to obtain the specific information of each job


4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spent more time showing the design that I was looking for, but what was most difficult for me was the part of accessing certain data, since it was accessing arrays of arrays or even arrays of objects
